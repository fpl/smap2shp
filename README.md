# smap2shp

This is a SMAP data to shapefile conversion tool. See http://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/
for information about the Soil Moisture Active/Passive satellite.
Daily data are distributed free of charge in HDF5 format. This little
script can convert the world-wide SMAP data into a sparse geo-referred
ESRI shapefile.
